# CAPP30239 Data Visualization for Policy Analysis

## About
This is my repository for my Data Visualization for Policy Analysis course. It will contain weekly homework and project assignments throughout the Fall quarter from September to December 2022.

## Goal
To acquire data visualization ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“‰ skills that can be used to engage people with challenging public policy and social impact issues. I am interested in data story-telling from an accessible standpoint that can reach a variety of audiences.
